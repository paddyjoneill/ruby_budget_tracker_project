# Budget Tracker in Ruby, Sinatra and PostgreSQL

Heroku link - https://ruby-budget-tracker.herokuapp.com/

This was my first week long project during the PSD course at CodeClan, Edinburgh and I chose to make a budget tracker. The brief appealed to me and I saw the opportunity for the project to be extended in many different ways once the MVP was complete. The project was created from scratch. I was most proud of the recurring bills feature which involved refactoring and adding an extra table in the database, that meant users wouldnâ€™t have to add in repeating monthly bills for each month.

## Still to do

- More responsive CSS.
